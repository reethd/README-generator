# Readme Generator

This readme generator takes user input and formats it into a professionally styled README.md file. Using this application allows the user to freely discuss the application, installation and usage instructions, contribution guidelines and licensing without having to worry about formatting and creating the file themselves.

This application can be run directly from its directory by using Nodejs and requires the installation of inquirer. This can be done by typing <npm i inquirer> in the command line.
